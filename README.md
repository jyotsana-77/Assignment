# Machine Learning
Machine learning subset of artificial intelligence.
## There are three types of machine learning.
**Supervised learning** - the data set used over here is labelled.
**Unsupervised learning** - the data set collected your has no labels.
**Reinforcement learning** - the model interact and learn from the environment.
## Types of supervised learning
* Regression - make the connection between independent and dependent variable.
* classification - categorisng is a given set of knowledge into classes. 
### Regression types- 
* linear regression 
* Logistic regression 
### Classification types-
